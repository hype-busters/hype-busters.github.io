# Hype Busters: Unveiling "Hype" in Biomedical Research

This project analyzes "hype" in biomedical research using a combination of linguistics and artificial intelligence. We aim to identify promotional language in scientific texts, understand its origins, and develop tools to detect it automatically. Our goal is to promote greater transparency and objectivity in scientific communication.

## Project Goals

*   **Identify Hype Trends**: Track the rise of promotional language in research abstracts and grant applications.
*   **Analyze Influences**: Investigate how funding announcements and institutional guidelines contribute to hype.
*   **Develop Detection Tools**: Create machine learning models to automatically identify hype in scientific writing.
